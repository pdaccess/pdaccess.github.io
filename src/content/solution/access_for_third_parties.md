## Temporary, role-based access for third parties

Temporary, role-based access for third parties, like contractors, vendors, and outsourced employees, to access specific enterprise systems or applications without the need for privileged credentials. Create custom roles for them with just the right access to conduct their tasks, while recording, logging, and monitoring their activities.
