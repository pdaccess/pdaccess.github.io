# Getting Started with pdaccess

Welcome to pdaccess! 🚀 We're excited to help you get started with our Privileged Access Management (PAM) and Identity and Access Management (IAM) solutions. This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and begin using our products effectively.

## Step 1: Sign Up or Log In

If you're new to pdaccess, start by signing up for an account on our platform. You can do this by visiting [pdaccess.com](http://pdaccess.com) and following the registration process. If you already have an account, simply log in using your credentials.

## Step 2: Explore the Dashboard

Once you're logged in, take some time to explore the dashboard. Here, you'll find an overview of your account, including any recent activity and important notifications. Familiarize yourself with the layout and navigation to make the most of your pdaccess experience.

## Step 3: Set Up Your Organization

If you're an administrator, your next step is to set up your organization within pdaccess. This involves configuring user roles, permissions, and access policies to align with your organization's security requirements. Refer to our documentation or contact support for assistance with this process.

## Step 4: Onboard Users

With your organization set up, it's time to onboard users onto the pdaccess platform. Invite team members and assign them appropriate roles and permissions based on their responsibilities within the organization. This ensures that everyone has the access they need to perform their tasks securely.

## Step 5: Secure Privileged Accounts

One of the core features of pdaccess is its ability to manage privileged accounts effectively. Take advantage of this functionality by securing your organization's privileged accounts, such as administrator and root accounts, using pdaccess's robust access controls and monitoring capabilities.

## Step 6: Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Enhance the security of your pdaccess account and your organization's data by implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA). This adds an extra layer of protection by requiring users to verify their identity using a second factor, such as a mobile app or hardware token, in addition to their password.

## Step 7: Monitor and Audit Activity

Regularly monitor and audit activity within your pdaccess account to ensure compliance with security policies and regulations. Use the built-in reporting and auditing features to track user activity, identify potential security risks, and take proactive measures to mitigate threats.
